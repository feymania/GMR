--- 1.0
 --> initial release

 --> Multidotting for warlock, first it will spread Corruption, then Curse of Agony.
 --> If you want to enable  Unstable Affliction for spreading, just delete "--" from strings 28-36.
 --> Note that if you have pulled too many mobs and they are not dying, it might just endlessly reapply dots and not use any other skills (like Life Tap)!
